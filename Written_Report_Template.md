The top graphic shows that the late spring early summer months generally have the highest volumes of new campaign launches, May leads the way followed by June and July. Not only do May, June, and July have the highest launch volumes but also the highest rate of success as shown in the bottom graphic above. December on the other hand has both the lowest launch volume and success rate.
